                        <p>After high school, I plan on going into a UC college even 
                        though theyâ€™ve gotten super competitive. I want to major in 
                        computer science and get at least a master's degree.  UC Berkeley 
                        and UCLA are my goals for colleges. I want to have the best 
                        possible GPA, preferably at least a 3.8 or 4.0 unweighted. 
                        I want to take all the computer programming classes in PLTW. 
                        I also want to be part of a lot of clubs and have a position 
                        to help run a club I feel dedicated to. I want to intern at 
                        some type of computer programming company. I have a good amount
                        of computing experience. I have taken classes on Python, Java 
                        and have even done some like Unity and Andriod Studio. I am part 
                        of a staff program, called White Stag, where once every month, a
                        group of about eighty youth staff members come together for the 
                        whole week and plan out a week of camp, the curriculum and 
                        schedule. At this camp during the summer, we teach children 
                        leadership skills. It requires tons of sacrifice. I have to 
                        give up a lot of other events and my free time to attend. Since 
                        I am there for a whole weekend I have to organize my time to 
                        finish all my homework somehow. As a group, all the staff bond 
                        and have fun but during camp we have to keep it serious and teach.
                        It takes dedication, time management, and to be professional.
