                        <p>Hi, my name is Michael Chen and I am a student at Dublin High. 
                        After high school, I have big plans for myself, including attending 
                        one of the rigorous UC colleges. I intend on  majoring in computer 
                        science and getting at least a master's degree.  UC Berkeley and UCLA 
                        are my goals for colleges. Through hard work, I hope to get a GPA of 
                        at least 3.8 unweighted. Throughout my life I have always maintained an at 
                        least 3.5 G.P.A. Since I intend on majoring in Computer Science, 
                        I plan on taking all possible courses involved during my high school 
                        career, including ap classes. I chose this profession becuase the pay
                        is very high and there it is a lot of available jobs. Right now, since 
                        AI is being worked on, there will definitely be more jobs for programmers.</p>
                        <p> What I am most proud of is being part of a staff program, called White 
                        Stag, where once every month, a group of about eighty youth staff 
                        members come together for the whole week and plan out a week of 
                        camp, the curriculum and schedule. At this camp during the summer, 
                        we teach children leadership skills through hardship and rigorous 
                        activities. Instead of spending my weekend relaxing, I take out my 
                        own time to think about what is best for these kids. However, this 
                        sudden exodus of time leaves me with minimal hours to finish my work
                        from school and other extracurricular activities. To adapt to this, 
                        I have developed a strong sense of time management to make it so I 
                        can maintain a healthy balance between my peers, family, and school.
                        During my time as a staff, I develop relationships with my fellow staff, 
                        however, because I must gain the respect of my students, I must keep my
                        profile professional at the same time likeable. I have learned that I am
                        hard working and can be very focused if I choose to. </p>
                        <p>I have developed many skills throughout my life that I feel can be transferred 
                        into more external uses. I have developed myself these skills by constantly 
                        challenging myself. The challenge that I imposed onto myself that influenced me 
                        in a positive manner was deciding to go years ahead of my peers in math and deciding 
                        to take accelerated courses beyond average. Throughout my whole life, I have felt 
                        that the common core curriculum wasn’t rigorous for me, that led me to try to learn 
                        beyond the norm. I would later find myself one or two years ahead of my peers 
                        throughout Middle and High School. In these courses, the concepts are much harder 
                        to grasp upon and become tedious, taking copious amounts to learn properly and to 
                        understand. To combat this, I have developed what I consider an open mind. I try my
                        best to ask questions when I don’t understand, I openly communicate with my teachers
                        to help better myself in the field, and I also try my best to convince my parents to 
                        get me a tutor if push comes to shove. I don’t give up easily and I am always in pursuit 
                        of a better me, emotionally, intellectually, physically and mentally. I constantly 
                        strive to find a better me. Through challenging myself in life, I have learned many 
                        transferable skills that range from leadership and dedication, all the way to time 
                        management. 
                        </p>
                        <p>In conclusion, I have done many programs and activities to set me on 
                        the right path in life. I try my hardest to be the best person I can be, 
                        thank you for taking your time to read my About Me. </p>
