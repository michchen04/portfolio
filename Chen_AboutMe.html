                        <p>After high school, I have big plans for myself, including attending 
                        one of the rigorous UC colleges. I intend on  majoring in computer 
                        science and getting at least a master's degree.  UC Berkeley and UCLA 
                        are my goals for colleges. Through hard work, I hope to get a GPA of 
                        at least 3.8 unweighted. Since I intend on majoring in Computer Science, 
                        I plan on taking all possible courses involved during my high school 
                        career, including ap classes. Another hope is to be involved with 
                        community activities and club events. Volunteering and holding a 
                        position in clubs I feel have a strong positive impact locally are 
                        ways I want to achieve this goal. Interning at a company that 
                        specializes in this field is what I dream for. This way, I could get 
                        a real feel about what I am getting myself into. Over the years, I 
                        have indulged myself in computing classes that range from Python, 
                        Java and have even done some like Unity and Android Studio. What 
                        I am most proud of is being part of a staff program, called White 
                        Stag, where once every month, a group of about eighty youth staff 
                        members come together for the whole week and plan out a week of 
                        camp, the curriculum and schedule. At this camp during the summer, 
                        we teach children leadership skills through hardship and rigorous 
                        activities. Instead of spending my weekend relaxing, I take out my 
                        own time to think about what is best for these kids. However, this 
                        sudden exodus of time leaves me with minimal hours to finish my work
                        from school and other extracurricular activities. To adapt to this, 
                        I have developed a strong sense of time management to make it so I 
                        can maintain a strong relationship with my peers, family and school.
                        During my time as a staff, I develop relationships with my fellow staff, 
                        however, because I must gain the respect of my students, I must keep my
                        profile professional at the same time likeable.
