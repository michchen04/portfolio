                            <p class="font-weight-light">Our goal for this project was to make a multi stage adventure game 
                        using Scratch that would consist of intricate puzzles and skill to complete. 
                        Before designing stage, we brainstormed countless ideas and chose the most 
                        challenging option to test our limits. We were helped by neighboring teams,
                        who aided us in brainstorming. We then proceeded to develop the idea further,
                        including more detailed and precise stages. Our main goal however, was to 
                        design a game where every level is a new experience and concept, totally 
                        unique and harder compared to the last. Our game consists of a multitude 
                        of sprites, including bats, lions, foxes, frogs and even a witch. The 
                        mechanics of the game include shooting arrows, lighting, and more. While 
                        in the midst of coding this project, I ran into quite a few roadblocks. 
                        Things I haven’t learned or have ever heard of. However this didn’t stop 
                        my partner and I. We delegated our work, searching the internet, watching 
                        tutorials, all to figure out how to make a small action happen, like a slight 
                        animation. Through research and learning we were able to come up with a system 
                        that counts time and health, we were able to create bosses with animations that 
                        would follow you. We made interactive gameplay where every action you do matter. 
                        My partner did most of the documentation and helped brainstorm, giving me his 
                        input and helping with the code when I was struggling. I decided to take a shot
                        at coding. I feel like we worked to our best potential.
