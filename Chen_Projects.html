                        <h5>Objective: Make a Multistage Adventure Game<h5>
                        <h5>Type of Project: Group Project<h5>
                            <p class="font-weight-light">Our goal for this project was to make a multi stage adventure game 
                        using Scratch that would consist of intricate puzzles and skill to complete. 
                        Before designing stage, we brainstormed countless ideas and chose the most 
                        challenging option to test our limits. We were helped by neighboring teams,
                        who aided us in brainstorming. We then proceeded to develop the idea further,
                        including more detailed and precise stages. Our main goal however, was to 
                        design a game where every level is a new experience and concept, totally 
                        unique and harder compared to the last. Our game consists of a multitude 
                        of sprites, including bats, lions, foxes, frogs, and even a witch. The 
                        mechanics of the game include shooting arrows, lighting, and more. While 
                        in the midst of coding this project, I ran into quite a few roadblocks. 
                        Things I haven’t learned or have ever heard of, however this didn’t stop 
                        my partner and I. We delegated our work, searching the internet, watching 
                        tutorials, all to figure out how to make a small action happen, like a slight 
                        animation. Through research and learning we were able to come up with a system 
                        that counts time and health, we were able to create bosses with animations that 
                        would follow you. We made interactive gameplay where every action you do matters. 
                        My partner did most of the documentation and helped brainstorm, giving me his 
                        input and helping with the code when I was struggling. I decided to take a shot
                        at coding. I feel like we worked to our best potential.

                        <h5>Objective: Edit an Image to Support a Cause<h5>
                        <h5>Type of Project: Group Project<h5>
                            <p class="font-weight-light"> Our algorithm uses a combination of masking, 
                            geometrical shapes/abstract art, human interaction, the ability to manipulate
                            multiple different parameters, superimposed logos and borders, and extra 
                            features to make our image manipulations even more memorable. Some strengths 
                            of our algorithm are that it meets all of the client’s criteria, it has 
                            simple and efficient user interactions, and can be easily reused. We included 
                            user input to make you able to edit each component of the image which 
                            consists of the border, icon and background. In the border, you can change 
                            the thickness and color to anything you desire. In the icon, you are able 
                            to choose the color and size to anything but you can also choose the icon 
                            location. The locations are Top-Right, Top-Left, Bottom-Left, and 
                            Bottom-Right. In the background, you can choose either polka dots or solid 
                            background. If you choose polka dots, you can choose the color for both the 
                            polka dots and the background behind them. If you choose background, you 
                            choose a color to set it to. We worked together pretty well and brainstormed 
                            good ideas and how to properly execute them. We were able to code to what I 
                            think was our best possible ability. We had a few differences which were 
                            bound to happen with multiple people editing the code. We both spent a good 
                            amount of time researching and telling each other what we plan to do. 
                            Documentation was a daily habit and I learned how to search and find the 
                            information necessary to program such a complex task I had never done before. 
                            This was by far the most challenging project I have done this year and 
                            surpassed the amount of hours I spent on other projects. I think this really 
                            brought out the hard working and focused state of mind from within me.
