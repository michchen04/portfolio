        <h1><p class="font-weight-bold">Skills</p></h1>
        <p class="font-weight-normal">I have developed many skills throughout my life that I feel can be transferred 
        into more external uses. I have developed myself these skills by constantly 
        challenging myself. The challenge that I imposed onto myself that influenced me 
        in a positive manner was deciding to go years ahead of my peers in math and deciding 
        to take accelerated courses beyond average. Throughout my whole life, I have felt 
        that the common core curriculum wasn’t rigorous for me, that led me to try to learn 
        beyond the norm. I would later find myself one or two years ahead of my peers 
        throughout Middle and High School. In these courses, the concepts are much harder 
        to grasp upon and become tedious, taking copious amounts to learn properly and to 
        understand. To combat this, I have developed what I consider an open mind. I try my
        best to ask questions when I don’t understand, I openly communicate with my teachers
        to help better myself in the field, and I also try my best to convince my parents to 
        get me a tutor if push comes to shove. I don’t give up easily and I am always in pursuit 
        of a better me, emotionally, intellectually, physically and mentally. I constantly 
        strive to find a better me. Through challenging myself in life, I have learned many 
        transferable skills that range from leadership and dedication, all the way to time 
        management. Thank you for taking the time to consider me.
